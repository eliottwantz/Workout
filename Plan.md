I want to create an ios gym workout tracking app with SwiftUI and SwiftData. It is 100% local, with no authentication or network, for single user only. I want the home screen to show the workout log, with a list of all past workouts. I want to be able to click on the workout and show the details of that workout. The details should show the exercises and supersets (if any) in that workout, in the order chosen by the user, and for each exercise, I want to be able to click on it and show the sets in the order chosen by the user, with reps and weight for each set. Each exercise should also include rest time, that the user can change. Finally, I want the user to be able to quickly copy a past workout to user for the current day workout, then adjust it as he wishes. Please use modern Swift syntax, leveraging protocols and extension when needed.

A superset contains multiple exercises that are performed back-to-back before a rest period. The user should be able to order them in between other exercises of the workout, as if it was one entity, because the user can decide to perform it at the start of the workout, in the middle, or at the end. I think in terms of how it is displayed in the UI, it should show that it is a superset and display the name of the exercises included, and to get more info, the user can click on it: instead of going to the exercise detail view like it does for a simple exercise, it should show the superset detail view, with the list of exercises in the superset and in which order they are performed. And the user can click on one of the exercise to go to the exercise detail view. Do you understand how I want to handle supersets?

For ordering, I to be able to drag and drop the item in the new position within the list. I don't want the user to have to manually enter the order number.

The current day workout is just a regular workout, meaning that it will automatically have the current date of the day assigned.

For editing, I want the user to be able to edit any workout: past workouts and todays workout. He takes full ownership of his changes: if he removes an exercise of a past workout, it's his change and was meant to be.

For the UI, I want the home screen to show a list of all past workouts. For the workout detail view, I want to show all the exercises and potentially supersets in the workouts, and correctly ordered. For the exercise view, a list of all sets correctly ordered. For the superset view, a list of all exercises in the superset, correctly ordered. I would also want to have a separate view where the user can add new exercises: since the app is completely local, it is the user's responsibility to add the exercises to the app. Then app should then store that exercise and make it available to user in a workout. So when the user wants to add exercise to a workout, he doesn't type the exercise name, but a searchable list with all exercises he added is showed, so that he can select one or more to add. So if he wants to do squats, and he did not add that exercise yet, he goes to that screen to add that exercise to the app. Then goes to his workout, click on "Add exercise" button or something like that, and the searchable list of exercises he has added to the app is presented, where he can select Squat and click on "Add exercises".
